# 2023 portfolio

This is my portfolio website I created using React and Tailwind CSS. I set this website up using react-router-dom to navigate more efficiently. I also implemented my very first dark and light mode filter switch using Tailwind.

## Description

The purpose of this project was to display my skills and projects using React and Tailwind.
I also wanted to test my mobile responsive skills.
This was a great way to test my styling of light and dark mode.
I have also implemented the React date function to get live updates on the date and time.
